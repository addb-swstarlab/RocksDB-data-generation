# RocksDB
RocksDB is a disk based database that can achieve fast data writing performance. 
Generation valuable RocksDB data is important for RocksDB optimization and analyzation studies. 
However, generating the useful data is a complex, difficult and time consuming task. 
This project is aiming at generating valuable RocksDB data with specific workload using db_bench and do some test for data analysis.
Users can also change RocksDB parameters while generating data.

If you want to apply this project to your own database, please remember to change parameter options as well as related files.
