RocksDB is a disk based database that can achieve fast data writing performance. Generation valuable RocksDB data is important for RocksDB optimization and analyzation studies. However, generating these data is a complex, difficult and time consuming task. This project is aiming at generating valuable RocksDB data with specific workload using db_bench. Users can also change RocksDB parameters while generating data.
